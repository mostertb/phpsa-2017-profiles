        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Once again this year, a core theme at the <a href="http://phpsouthafrica.com" target="_blank">PHP SA 2017
            Conference</a>
          has been the importance of getting involved in OpenSource projects. This is why we have dusted off our yearly
          humorous educational project.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have been thinking about getting involved in OpenSource but the whole exercise seems daunting, we
          invite
          you to sign up a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Account</a> and submit a
          <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/" target="_blank">Pull Request</a> to the
          the <a href="https://github.com/mostertb/phpsa-2017-profiles">phpsa-2017-profiles</a> project (the code that
          generates this
          page) as a way to get you started.

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
          The idea is to provide a safe environment in which to practice the mechanics of contributing to a GitHub
          project in order to break down one more barrier between you and one of the world's most addictive hobbies.<br>
          If you're already an open source contributor/maintainer, this is also a great platform to recommend projects
          for other attendee to get involved in.
        </p>
        <p>
          By submitting a profile, you also get an opportunity introduce yourself and jump into the all-important
          "Hallway Track"
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, though, its fun to hack away at some code over the week
        </p>

            <strong>Please Note:</strong> While not expressly forbidden, profile submissions to this project are
            probably
            not going to win you any conference prizes. Larger framework submissions may though.
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Once you've gotten your feet wet by submitting your first pull request, we recommend that you go have a
          look at Digital Ocean's <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Hacktoberfest</a>
          initiative
        </p>
        <p>You may also want to look at <strong>TODO.md</strong> in this project if you'd like to continue to contribute
          here...</p>

        <h4>2015</h4>
        <p>
          At the PHP Craft Conference 2015 the contributors of this project played a little joke.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2015 conference organisers had decided to hold a competition to win a
          <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank">JetBrains PHPStorm</a> license. To enter,
          attendees simply had to submit a Pull Request... to any OpenSource project. So we created a project!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Everyone was disqualified... :)</strong>
        </p>

        <h4>2016</h4>
        <p>
          At the 2016 conferenece we tried to go legitimate to see if we could get away with it. We did. Zander was
          grumpy
          with us. It was hilarious
        </p>

        <h4>2017</h4>
        <p>
          This year, the aim is to go even bigger. If we make a success once again, this will officially become a
          PHP SA tradition!
