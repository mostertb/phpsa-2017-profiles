                <p>
                    Once again this year, a core theme at the <a href="http://phpsouthafrica.com" target="_blank">PHP SA 2017 Conference</a>
                    has been the importance of getting involved in OpenSource projects. This is why we have dusted off our yearly
                    humorous educational project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you have been thinking about getting involved in OpenSource but the whole exercise seems daunting, we invite
                    you to sign up a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Account</a> and submit a
                    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/" target="_blank">Pull Request</a> to the
                    the <a href="https://github.com/mostertb/phpsa-2017-profiles">phpsa-2017-profiles</a> project (the code that generates this
                    page) as a way to get you started.

                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is to provide a safe environment in which to practice the mechanics of contributing to a GitHub
                    project in order to break down one more barrier between you and one of the world's most addictive hobbies.<br>
                    If you're already an open source contributor/maintainer, this is also a great platform to recommend projects
                    for other attendee to get involved in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By submitting a profile, you also get an opportunity introduce yourself and jump into the all-important "Hallway Track"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most importantly, though, its fun to hack away at some code over the week
                </p>

                                                      not going to win you any conference prizes. Larger framework submissions may though.

                    Once you've gotten your feet wet by submitting your first pull request, we recommend that you go have a
                    look at Digital Ocean's <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Hacktoberfest</a>

                <h4>2015</h4>
                <p>
                    At the PHP Craft Conference 2015 the contributors of this project played a little joke.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2015 conference organisers had decided to hold a competition to win a
                    <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank">JetBrains PHPStorm</a> license. To enter,
                    attendees simply had to submit a Pull Request... to any OpenSource project. So we created a project!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Everyone was disqualified... :)</strong>
                </p>

                <h4>2016</h4>
                <p>
                    At the 2016 conferenece we tried to go legitimate to see if we could get away with it. We did. Zander was grumpy
                    with us. It was hilarious
                </p>

                <h4>2017</h4>
                <p>
                    This year, the aim is to go even bigger. If we make a success once again, this will officially become a
                    PHP SA tradition!
