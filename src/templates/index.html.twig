            <h1>PHP South Africa 2017 Attendee Profiles</h1>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Once again this year, a core theme at the <a href="http://phpsouthafrica.com" target="_blank">PHP SA 2017 Conference</a>
                has been the importance of getting involved in OpenSource projects. This is why we have dusted off our yearly
                humorous educational project.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have been thinking about getting involved in OpenSource but the whole exercise seems daunting, we invite
                you to sign up a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Account</a> and submit a
                <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/" target="_blank">Pull Request</a> to the
                the <a href="https://github.com/mostertb/phpsa-2017-profiles">phpsa-2017-profiles</a> project (the code that generates this
                page) as a way to get you started.
            </p>

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
                The main idea is to provide a safe environment in which to practice the mechanics of contributing to a GitHub
                project in order to break down one more barrier between you and one of the world's most addictive hobbies.<br>
                If you're already an open source contributor/maintainer, this is also a great platform to recommend projects
                for other attendee to get involved in.
            </p>
            <p>
                By submitting a profile, you also get an opportunity introduce yourself and jump into the all-important "Hallway Track"
            </p>
            <p>
                Most importantly, though, its fun to hack away at some code over the week
            </p>

            <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                <p class="text-center">
                    <strong>Please Note:</strong> While not expressly forbidden, profile submissions to this project are probably
                    not going to win you any conference prizes. Larger framework submissions may though.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Once you've gotten your feet wet by submitting your first pull request, we recommend that you go have a
                look at Digital Ocean's <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Hacktoberfest</a>
                initiative
            </p>
            <p>You may also want to look at <strong>TODO.md</strong> in this project if you'd like to continue to contribute here...</p>

                            This year we have stickers! Once you have had your Pull Request accepted, go say hi to Brad Mostert
                            and he'll give you a GitHub sticker. <br>
                            There are the Standard Die-Cut Stickers for profile submissions as well as a selection of their
                            custom stickers available to more interesteing submissions!

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>So we've done this twice before...</p>

            <h4>2015</h4>
            <p>
                At the PHP Craft Conference 2015 the contributors of this project played a little joke.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2015 conference organisers had decided to hold a competition to win a
                <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank">JetBrains PHPStorm</a> license. To enter,
                attendees simply had to submit a Pull Request... to any OpenSource project. So we created a project!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Everyone was disqualified... :)</strong>
            </p>

            <h4>2016</h4>
            <p>
                At the 2016 conferenece we tried to go legitimate to see if we could get away with it. We did. Zander was grumpy
                with us. It was hilarious
            </p>

            <h4>2017</h4>
            <p>
                This year, the aim is to go even bigger. If we make a success once again, this will officially become a
                PHP SA tradition!
            </p>
